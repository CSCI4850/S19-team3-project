### Data from: P. Cortez and A. Silva. Using Data Mining to Predict Secondary School Student Performance. In A. Brito and J. Teixeira Eds., Proceedings of 5th FUture BUsiness TEChnology Conference (FUBUTEC 2008) pp. 5-12, Porto, Portugal, April, 2008, EUROSIS, ISBN 978-9077381-39-7.

## Our Aims
#### We want to create a network to predict student's final grades similar to that of Cortez and Silva and see if we can improve its performance by removing features that aren't necessary for the network to produce accurate results. Our key aim, however, is to use this neural network to find the top five features that are most important to network accuracy and analyze how these features affect student performance.

## Why Should You Care?
#### In order to best prepare students for the future, we need to look deeper into what can positively and negatively affect student performance. After running through this demo, you should have an idea of how to use neural networks to do just that. These skills are transferable. They can be used not only to gain a deeper understanding of education but other subjects that are crucial to the success of our world such as climate change and poverty levels. There's so much that can be done!
