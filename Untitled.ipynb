    "### The first sentence of the introduction seemed irrelevant to the content of this paper and made for a weak introduction – I would consider removing this. Describing goals of the paper and also providing the reader with a thorough understanding of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging formulated the background very well. The section over *Tools and Previous Works* was very thorough; Descriptions of tools used were short enough to not distract from the main analysis but were descriptive enough to understand what they do on a high level – this was a strong element. The *methods* section also shared the same strong qualities as *Tools and Previous Works*, however, the statement “4D matrix (subject#, X, Y, Z, t). An image of the scan can be seen in fig. 1” and figure 1 does not explain what t represents; Only X, Y, and Z are shown in figure 1.  Subject# is also not clearly explained of its representation.  In the *Discussion* section, it is suggested that the convolution net could likely achieve accuracy similar to feed forward net if it was given “enough training time”, however, the convolution net was previously mentioned in the *Results* section that it suffered from overfitting. This suggestion seems counter intuitive of fixing an overfitting neural net. Overall, this paper flowed quite nice and demonstrated thorough research in Schizophrenia detection utilizing neural network models. "
